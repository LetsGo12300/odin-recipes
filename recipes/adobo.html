        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Chicken adobo is a classic dish in the cuisine of the Philippines, one that predates any external influence. This version is based on a more modern iteration, using soy sauce to provide savory depth and rice vinegar for adobo's signature acidity. Browning the meat, while optional, improves the depth of flavor in both the chicken and the sauce, and you can take that even further by broiling the braised chicken after it's fully cooked.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken leg quarters (about 2 pounds)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons low-sodium Japanese soy sauce</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as peanut, canola or grapeseed</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves, preferably fresh</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns, coarsely cracked, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 ounces cane vinegar, or 1 1/2 ounces distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with cool water to make a slurry, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the excess skin and large lumps of fat from the chicken.</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken pieces with the soy sauce and smashed garlic for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and pat dry. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once hot, place the chicken legs into the pan, working in batches if necessary, and brown on both sides. </li>
            <li>When all the pieces are browned, add the bay leaves and cracked peppercorns and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Return all the chicken pieces to the pot along with the reserved soy and garlic marinade and add the chicken stock. Bring to a low boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook until tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the chicken is tender, add the sugar and vinegar. Simmer another 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. The adobo should have a kick of vinegar but taste balanced. If desired, stir in some of the slurry to thicken the liquid into a sauce. Serve over steamed rice with a fresh grind of black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
